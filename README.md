# Doodle-Jump
This project is for a game called "Doodle Jump."
This code creates the platforms, the doodler, and the game loop.
The game loop is responsible for moving the platforms, the doodler, and checking for collisions.
The code also includes functions for moving the doodler left, right, and up.
The start function initializes the game and starts the game loop.
